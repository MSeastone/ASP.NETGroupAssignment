# ASP.NETGroupAssignment

Language: C#, html, css and bootstrap

This was a group assignment by: Johan/Simon/Louis/Madelene

Were we buildt a Book Review MVC webapp using ASP.NETCore in Visual Studio
the site had 3 entities: books, authors, reviews.

User can add reviews but not update a created review.

Authors and books is CRUD:able, authors is a one-to-one relationship to books.

Books is a many-to-one relationship to authors

This project gave me so much more usable tips and tricks, so I want to give a
bigtime shoutout to the lads I was working with!!! THANK YOU!

Have a nice day! // Madelene :)
